# Online TTT-LoRA Implementation Plan

This is a forward-looking design doc, written after reading the prior
post-mortem in `docs/test-time-training-lora.md` and a code-archaeology pass
through prime-rl's existing LoRA / multi-run / inference machinery.

The headline finding is that **most of the infrastructure required for
online test-time training already exists in prime-rl** — it was built for a
different purpose (multi-tenant SFT runs sharing one trainer), but the
shape lines up almost 1-to-1 with what TTT needs. The scope of work is
substantially smaller than the prior post-mortem implies; the new code is
mostly session-lifecycle plumbing and a per-rollout learner mode.

The companion document `docs/ttt-cheat-sheet.md` is the one-pager of "do
this / don't do that" pulled from the post-mortem; that's the right
reference for the cluster session.

## Goal recap

Per-rollout LoRA `Phi_ttt` trained online on exact rollout tokens, used to
extend effective context without paying full attention over the long
history every turn. Trainer must replay completion spans under the
adapter snapshot that was active when those tokens were sampled, so
gradients flow into base `Theta` correctly.

Tool-output world-modeling (SFT-on-tool-body) is **independent** and
already landed on `feat/sft-on-tool-outputs`. TTT does not depend on it
and vice versa. As of 2026-05-20 the SFT-on-tool-outputs runs are live
on the cluster and stepping cleanly — the `cmb-both-ct-a0.5` variant is
leading the RL baseline on `forth-lang-test/pass@1`, validating the SFT
path behaviorally.

## Cluster context (2026-05-20)

- H200 (140 GiB) × 8 per node, 2-4 nodes per run.
- `/beegfs` shared storage (140T total, ~25T free).
- Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 cached at `/beegfs/huggingface/hub/`.
- vLLM `0.21.0` pinned; weight broadcast type is `nccl` in production.
- Production Forth runs use `optim_cpu_offload=true` to stay under
  140 GiB peak (was 126.6 GiB before); TTT adds learner-side
  forward+backward, so memory accounting matters.
- The trainer-side LoRA defaults are rank=16, alpha=32,
  target_modules covering MLP + attention + MoE variants.
- **Multi-LoRA infrastructure is production-hardened**: same code path
  is used in hosted training where many users each have their own
  adapter, and it's stable. The TTT-specific risk surface is the
  chunked-snapshot churn pattern (32 snapshots/rollout × 512
  rollouts/step), not the multi-LoRA machinery itself.
- **The gate_up_proj layerwise fix landed upstream** (PR #2482,
  `b2ba40b5e` on `main`), so it's in our branches via the ancestor
  chain. The post-mortem's "vLLM crashes on mid-rollout weight update"
  failure mode is no longer a known bug — only a defensive Phase A
  precaution (one less moving part during smoke).
- **Live risk**: per the `daniel/gptoss-lora-nan-repro` HANDOVER, vLLM
  worker state can be poisoned when the same `lora_int_id` is reused
  for a refreshed adapter. The TTT design avoids this by construction:
  each chunk snapshot gets a fresh id and name, never reused. LRU
  eviction handles cleanup. This needs to be a hard invariant, not a
  convention.

## Existing prime-rl machinery we will reuse

These are the load-bearing facts that shape the design.

### Trainer: native multi-LoRA with per-token routing

`src/prime_rl/trainer/lora.py` + `src/prime_rl/trainer/models/layers/lora/`:

- `MultiLoRALinear` wraps `nn.Linear` with `n_adapters` slots and
  `torch._grouped_mm`-based grouped GEMM. A single forward pass can route
  different tokens through different adapter slots.
- Routing is controlled by two globals: `LORA_NUM_TOKENS: [n_adapters]`
  (contiguous token counts per adapter in the flattened batch) and
  `SCALING_FACTORS: [n_adapters]` (per-adapter scale, defaults to a sentinel
  `1e6` so unused slots fail loudly if accidentally used).
- `MultiLoRAGroupedExperts` / `MultiLoRANonGatedGroupedExperts` /
  `MultiLoRAGptOssGroupedExperts` cover the MoE cases.
- `apply_lora_to_model()` is the entry point; it must run **before** FSDP
  setup, so adapter slot count is fixed at trainer boot.

### Trainer: MultiRunManager session lifecycle

`src/prime_rl/trainer/runs.py` + `docs/multi_run_manager.md`:

- Pre-allocates `max_runs` adapter slots in the model.
- Manages bidirectional `run_id <-> idx` mapping, per-run progress,
  per-run optimizer/scheduler via creation/deletion hooks.
- Discovery is filesystem-scan based today (`output_dir/run_*`).
- `evict_run(idx, reason)` is a clean shutdown path; orchestrator picks
  up the reason from `evicted.txt`.
- Already exposes `get_state_dict_for_run(idx)` (HF-compatible adapter
  state dict) and `reset_run_parameters(idx)`.

### Inference: dynamic multi-LoRA via patched vLLM

`src/prime_rl/inference/patches.py` + `src/prime_rl/inference/vllm/server.py`:

- vLLM's native multi-LoRA: `lora_request: LoRARequest(lora_name,
  lora_int_id, lora_path)` per completion request.
- Patched `_patched_load_adapter` and `_patched__apply_adapters` allow
  in-place dynamic loading.
- `POST /load_lora_adapter` endpoint loads an adapter by path; the
  orchestrator scheduler today uses one persistent `lora_name`.

### Orchestrator: continuous batching with per-task state

`src/prime_rl/orchestrator/scheduler.py`:

- `Scheduler` tracks `inflight_requests: dict[asyncio.Task, InflightRequest]`.
- One `lora_name` field today; per-rollout `lora_name` is a small
  extension, not a redesign.

### Verifiers: trajectory_id is already a first-class concept

`deps/verifiers/verifiers/types.py`, `runtime.py`:

- Every rollout has `trajectory_id: str` in its state, set by the
  runtime, propagated into the rollout output.
- This is the natural session identifier — no new id needs to be minted.

### SFT-on-tool-outputs: per-env config pattern

`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/orchestrator.py`:

- `SFTConfig` lives on `TrainEnvConfig.sft`. Per-env opt-in via setting
  `sft.on_tool_outputs = true`.
- `OrchestratorExperimentalConfig` exists but is empty — natural home
  for global `ttt: TTTConfig`.

### Mapping to existing concepts

| TTT concept           | Existing prime-rl concept                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Session               | "Run" in `MultiRunManager`                         |
| Session id            | `trajectory_id` from verifiers                     |
| Session LoRA          | `MultiLoRALinear` adapter slot                     |
| Chunk snapshot        | Materialized via `get_state_dict_for_run(idx)`     |
| Frozen base           | Trainer model with `freeze_all_except_lora_and_specified` |
| Inference adapter     | `LoRARequest` in vLLM, loaded via patched path     |
| Per-env opt-in        | New flag on `TrainEnvConfig.ttt_enabled`           |
| Global TTT config     | `OrchestratorExperimentalConfig.ttt`               |
| Sticky routing        | Scheduler `inflight_requests` keyed by task        |

This means the bulk of TTT is **wiring existing primitives**, not
inventing new ones.

### TTT learner as a repurposed multi-run trainer

The learner is a separate prime-rl process running in "session-trainer"
mode:

- `setup_multi_run_manager(max_runs = max_concurrent_sessions, ...)`.
- Base model wrapped with `MultiLoRALinear` via `apply_lora_to_model`;
  base is frozen by construction.
- Adapter slots correspond to live sessions; mapping is via RPC, not by
  scanning `run_*` directories.
- Sessions are created (`/start_session`), trained on chunks
  (`/prepare_turn`, `/complete_turn`), snapshotted, and evicted
  (`/finish_session` / `/abort_session`).
- Snapshot path: write `state_dict_for_run(idx)` to
  `adapter_dir/session_<id>/chunk_<k>` (shared FS visible to vLLM and
  trainer).
- Base weight refresh: on `update_weights` from main trainer, swap base
  via the existing NCCL or filesystem broadcast paths; LoRA slots are
  unaffected.

### Chunk-aligned training semantics

Identical to the prior post-mortem; no change. For
`update_every_tokens = N`:

- Tokens `[k·N, (k+1)·N)` are predicted under adapter `A_k`.
- After those tokens arrive, learner trains `A_k -> A_{k+1}` on the
  chunk.
- Snapshot `A_k` is materialized only when needed (lazy: on the next
  generation request that uses it, or when trainer asks for it).

### Replay on the trainer side

This is where the existing MultiLoRA gives us a big simplification.

**Trainer model is wrapped with `MultiLoRALinear` in TTT mode**, with
`n_adapters = R` where `R` is the maximum number of distinct chunk
adapters in any microbatch.

For each microbatch:

1. Look at the microbatch's `ttt_trace` entries. Collect the unique
   `(session_id, chunk_idx)` pairs — call this set `C`.
2. For each `(session, chunk)` in `C`, load its snapshot into a slot.
   The slot mapping is per-microbatch — slots are reused across
   microbatches.
3. Build `lora_num_tokens: [R]` such that token positions belonging to
   chunk `c` go into slot `slot_of(c)`. Tokens not assigned to any
   chunk (e.g., padding or pre-TTT prefix) go into a "no-LoRA" slot
   with `scaling_factor=0` (effectively base-only forward at those
   positions).
4. Forward + backward. LoRA params are **frozen** in this trainer
   (gradients only flow into the base via the FSDP optimizer). The
   adapter contribution still flows through autograd to give the base
   the right effective loss landscape, but the adapter tensors
   themselves don't get updated.
5. Backward step → standard optimizer step on Theta.
6. After all DP ranks finish step, rank 0 reaps consumed snapshots.

**Implication**: the trainer needs an opt-in mode where it loads LoRA
weights as a frozen forward-only contribution. This is a small
extension to the existing `apply_lora_to_model` path — the existing path
sets `requires_grad=True` for LoRA params; we need the opposite for TTT
replay.

The number of forwards per training step is *unchanged* — one forward
per microbatch, just with adapter-routed tokens. This is materially
cheaper than the per-chunk-forward design I sketched before.

### vLLM side

Per-rollout `lora_name` already works in the scheduler; just needs to
be per-task instead of one global string. Per-turn the orchestrator
passes `lora_name = f"sess_{session_id}_chk_{chunk_idx}"` (or some
content hash) into the completion request, and vLLM loads it via the
patched `load_lora_adapter` if not cached.

The patched LRU manager handles cache eviction. We should make
`max_loras` in the vLLM config the binding knob for memory pressure,
sized to roughly `max_concurrent_generation_requests` rather than
`max_concurrent_sessions`.

## Data structures

```python
# transport/types.py — additions to TrainingSample (msgspec.Struct)
class TTTChunk(msgspec.Struct, frozen=True):
    chunk_idx: int
    adapter_handle: str    # path or content hash; opaque to transport
    token_start: int       # offset into the (prompt_ids + completion_ids) joined sequence
    token_end: int
    base_step: int         # Theta version when this snapshot was made

class TrainingSample(...):
    ...existing fields...
    ttt_trace: list[TTTChunk] | None = None
    ttt_session_id: str | None = None
```

The orchestrator builds `ttt_trace` as the rollout proceeds. Packing
preserves it. Microbatch carries a flat representation:

```python
class MicroBatch(...):
    ...
    ttt_chunk_assignment: list[int] | None  # parallel to input_ids; chunk index or -1
    ttt_adapter_handles: list[str] | None   # indexed by chunk index
```

A `-1` chunk assignment means "no LoRA at this position" (handled via
scaling_factor=0 in the dedicated slot).

## Config schema

```python
# packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/orchestrator.py

class TTTLoRAConfig(BaseConfig):
    rank: int = 8
    alpha: float = 16.0
    dropout: float = 0.0
    target_modules: list[str] = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"]

class TTTConfig(BaseConfig):
    """Global TTT settings. None disables TTT entirely."""
    mode: Literal["online_lora"] = "online_lora"
    window_seq_len: int = 8192
    total_seq_len: int = 32768
    update_every_tokens: int = 1024
    require_exact_token_ids: bool = True
    adapter_dir: Path  # shared FS visible to learner, vLLM, trainer
    lora: TTTLoRAConfig = TTTLoRAConfig()
    learner: TTTLearnerConfig = TTTLearnerConfig()

class TTTLearnerConfig(BaseConfig):
    endpoints: list[str]               # learner addresses; sticky-routed by trajectory_id
    max_sessions_per_learner: int = 64
    session_offload: Literal["cpu_after_request", "gpu_pinned"] = "cpu_after_request"
    unload_vllm_adapters: bool = True
    delete_consumed_adapters: bool = True

class OrchestratorExperimentalConfig(BaseConfig):
    ttt: TTTConfig | None = None       # None = TTT disabled globally

class TrainEnvConfig(EnvConfig):
    ...
    sft: SFTConfig | None = None
    ttt_enabled: bool = False          # per-env opt-in; requires global ttt config
```

**Validation hooks** at orchestrator config load:

1. `experimental.ttt` set → `use_renderer=true` and
   `use_token_client=false`.
2. `experimental.ttt` set → `window_seq_len > max_completion_tokens +
   headroom`. The headroom value should be a small constant (~64 or
   `max_special_tokens_per_turn`) baked into the validator.
3. `experimental.ttt` set → `adapter_dir` writeable from this process.
4. `train.env[i].ttt_enabled = true` → `experimental.ttt` is not None.

## Files that change

Mapped to phases. Phase A is the smoke target.

### Phase A (single learner, one session at a time, disk transport)

- `packages/prime-rl-configs/.../orchestrator.py` — add config classes
  above.
- `src/prime_rl/ttt_learner/__init__.py` — new package
- `src/prime_rl/ttt_learner/server.py` — FastAPI service:
  `/start_session`, `/prepare_turn`, `/complete_turn`,
  `/finish_session`, `/abort_session`, `/update_base_weights`,
  `/health`
- `src/prime_rl/ttt_learner/session.py` — per-session state: pending
  token buffer, chunk boundary tracking, snapshot bookkeeping
- `src/prime_rl/ttt_learner/training.py` — chunk-aligned forward/backward
- `src/prime_rl/orchestrator/ttt_client.py` — async client to learner;
  sticky routing on trajectory_id
- `src/prime_rl/orchestrator/trajectories.py` — hook
  `interleave_rollout` to call learner `prepare_turn`/`complete_turn`
  and accumulate `ttt_trace`; pass `lora_name` per turn
- `src/prime_rl/orchestrator/scheduler.py` — per-task `lora_name` (small
  edit)
- `src/prime_rl/transport/types.py` — `ttt_trace`,
  `ttt_session_id` on `TrainingSample`; `ttt_chunk_assignment`,
  `ttt_adapter_handles` on `MicroBatch`
- `src/prime_rl/trainer/rl/data.py` — propagate ttt fields through
  `_micro_batch_to_tensor`
- `src/prime_rl/trainer/rl/packer.py` — preserve ttt fields through
  packing
- `src/prime_rl/trainer/batch.py` — preserve through `prepare_sample`
- `src/prime_rl/trainer/rl/train.py` — TTT-mode setup: apply LoRA to
  trainer model in frozen mode; per-microbatch load chunk snapshots
  into slots, set `lora_num_tokens` and `scaling_factors`
- `src/prime_rl/trainer/lora.py` — `apply_lora_to_model_frozen` variant
  for replay (or a flag on the existing fn)
- Snapshot reaper: after step commit, rank 0 deletes consumed adapter
  dirs

### Phase B (multi-tenant single learner, per-chunk replay)

- Multi-tenant in learner: per-session state offload to CPU between
  requests
- Per-chunk replay span splitting (currently one-replay-per-rollout)

### Phase C (multi-learner)

- `ttt_client.py`: sticky shard routing
- Admission control (503 on overflow)
- Adapter shm transport instead of disk (`/dev/shm` or vLLM in-process
  adapter API)

### Phase D (perf)

- Multi-tenant batched LoRA training in learner (concatenate sessions'
  chunks into one forward, mask cross-session attention, per-session
  grad accumulation)
- Sliding-window training (cap learner forward at
  `window_seq_len`)
- Replay batching by adapter handle across the global batch

## Hard correctness invariants

These must be enforced at boot or in CI:

1. `experimental.ttt` set → `use_renderer=true, use_token_client=false`.
2. `experimental.ttt` set → `window_seq_len > max_completion_tokens +
   headroom`. Headroom is a small constant; fail loudly otherwise.
3. `vllm.max_lora_rank >= experimental.ttt.lora.rank`.
4. `adapter_dir` writeable from learner, vLLM, trainer (probe at boot).
5. No global tool filter — TTT control surface only exposes
   per-env `ttt_enabled`. Tool-name filtering for SFT lives in
   `TrainEnvConfig.sft.tool_names` (already implemented).
6. `session_id == trajectory_id` — derived, not minted. Survives
   orchestrator restarts and matches rollout traces 1-to-1.
7. **No mid-rollout base weight refresh in Phase A.** Active sessions
   finish under their start-time base; PipelineRL-style updates queue
   instead of preempt. Revisit after smoke.
8. **One TTT sample per rollout in Phase A.** Split spans across
   microbatches only after the span-splitting code is unit-tested
   (Phase B).
9. LoRA replay slots are `requires_grad=False`. Gradient must not flow
   into the adapter. Add a unit test for this.
10. Snapshot deletion is reference-counted: vLLM "done" + trainer "done"
    + DP-step-committed. Never delete on session close alone.
11. **Every chunk snapshot gets a fresh `lora_int_id` and a fresh
    `lora_name`.** Never reuse. Per the
    `daniel/gptoss-lora-nan-repro` HANDOVER, id reuse can poison
    worker-side adapter state. LRU eviction in vLLM handles cleanup.
    Enforce in `ttt_client.py`: id generator is a monotonic counter,
    name encodes `(trajectory_id, chunk_idx)`.

## Performance considerations under high concurrency

In rough priority order:

1. **vLLM adapter delivery via disk vs shm**. Disk is fine for Phase A
   smoke but the volume of snapshots (~32 per rollout at 32k context)
   will get painful. Phase C moves to `/dev/shm` for the hot path; disk
   only as a fallback / for cross-host trainer replay.
2. **Multi-tenant batched LoRA training in learner**. Use the existing
   `MultiLoRALinear` per-token routing to batch multiple sessions'
   chunks in one forward. Phase D.
3. **Replay batching by adapter on trainer**. The MultiLoRA forward
   already routes tokens to slots, so multiple microbatches sharing the
   same chunk-adapter use the same loaded weights without swap. The
   bottleneck is the snapshot load itself; consider mmapping.
4. **Sliding-window training in learner**. Train on the most recent
   `window_seq_len` tokens, not the full session. Bounds per-chunk
   cost. Generation already uses a window, so semantically consistent.
5. **Bounded admission**: learner returns 503 at capacity; orchestrator
   uses existing concurrency knobs to back off.

## Phased delivery

- **Phase A — smoke**: one learner, one session per learner at a time,
  disk transport, one-replay-per-rollout under final adapter, Forth +
  one held-out retrieval task. Goal: correctness end-to-end. The
  one-replay-under-final-adapter simplification is biased for
  multi-chunk completion samples but is fine as a smoke baseline.
- **Phase B — correctness expansion**: multi-tenant per learner with
  CPU offload; per-chunk replay; span-split TTT samples; trajectory-id
  session lifecycle plumbed everywhere; abort-on-failure RPC.
- **Phase C — concurrency**: multi-learner shards with sticky routing;
  admission control; adapter shm transport; vLLM persistent LoRA slot
  rotation.
- **Phase D — perf**: multi-tenant batched LoRA training; sliding-window
  training; replay batching by adapter; async snapshot pipeline.

The prior runs documented in `test-time-training-lora.md` jumped to ~C
and died on items from A. Don't skip A.

## Open questions for the cluster session

Concrete probe specs live in `docs/ttt-probes.md`. Summary of what
each one resolves:

1. **Snapshot churn** — per-adapter vLLM load latency at the pinned
   0.21.0 with Qwen3-4B. Decides disk vs shm transport for Phase A.
2. **Learner forward+backward latency** — 1024-token chunk on a single
   H200. Decides whether single-tenant learner can keep up with
   between-chunk generation gaps.
3. **MultiLoRA forward overhead vs n_adapters** — `_grouped_mm` path at
   `n_adapters ∈ {1, 8, 64, 256, 1024}`. Bounds how wide a replay
   microbatch can be.
4. **`/beegfs` write throughput** — producer-side snapshot write
   latency. Decides whether shm is needed even on the producer.

The SFT smoke task is **already done implicitly** — the live Forth
runs (`forth-lang-qwen-{rl,cmb-code-ct,cmb-both-ct}-r1`) validate the
SFT-on-tool-outputs path. No separate smoke needed.

The dynamic-base-update-with-active-LoRAs failure is **resolved
upstream** (PR #2482) and no longer needs reproduction. We still
queue weight updates between rollouts in Phase A as a conservatism
choice, not because of a known bug.

## Minimal safe run checklist

Pulled from the post-mortem; the cheat-sheet has the full version. The
TTT-specific ones:

1. Branches: code on `feat/ttt-online-lora`, configs on the matching
   branch in research-configs.
2. `orchestrator.use_renderer = true`, `use_token_client = false`.
3. `window_seq_len > max_completion_tokens + headroom`.
4. `max_total_completion_tokens` carries the long-trajectory budget.
5. vLLM `enable_lora=true`, `max_lora_rank >= ttt.lora.rank`,
   `max_loras` sized to concurrent generation requests.
6. `adapter_dir` on shared FS visible to learner + vLLM + trainer.
7. Learner concurrency sized for the load — start small, profile.
8. SFT tool-name filters per-env, never global.
9. Eval envs don't inherit train-only filters.
10. Sessions close after train and eval rollouts.
11. Logs show real prompt budgets, not `prompt_tokens=1`.
12. W&B shows nonzero rollout progress and sane eval completion rates
    before treating the run as valid.
